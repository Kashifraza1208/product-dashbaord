# 📦 Product Dashboard

A **React + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui** dashboard using the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products).
It includes a responsive layout, product table, search & pagination, and full CRUD operations with **React Query**.



## 🚀 What I Did

* Built **responsive layout** (sidebar + header + content).
* Used **shadcn/ui** components (`Card`, `Table`, `Dialog`, `Button`, `Skeleton`).
* Fetched products with **pagination, search, and filters**.
* Implemented **CRUD**: Add, Edit, Delete with dialogs.
* Integrated **React Query** for fetching, caching, and mutations.
* Added **loading skeletons, error handling, empty states**.
* Bonus: Category filter, total count, artificial delay.

Do you want me to also **add short screenshots (table, add product dialog, etc.)** in the README so it looks more impressive?
